title: On the closure of aggregation rules for imprecise probabilities
abstract: 'We consider the problem of aggregating a number of imprecise probability
  models into a joint one, and compare four aggregation rules: conjunction, disjunction,
  mixture and Pareto. We investigate for which particular cases of imprecise probability
  models these operators are closed, meaning that the output belongs to the same family
  as the inputs. Specifically, we analyse this problem for comparative probability
  models, $2$-monotone capacities, probability intervals, belief functions, p-boxes
  and minitive measures.'
