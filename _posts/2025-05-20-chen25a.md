title: Credal discrete classifier
abstract: This paper presents a novel extension of the discrete Bayesian classifier
  (DBC) into a set-valued classification framework grounded in imprecise probability
  theory. The standard DBC framework, which relies on partitioning the input space
  into profiles and estimating class-conditional probabilities, may not be very robust
  to distribution changes or imperfections in observed data. In the hope to mitigate
  such issues, we introduce the Credal Discrete Classifier (CDC), an imprecise-probabilistic
  extension of the traditional Bayesian approach. By representing uncertainties in
  the estimated probabilities through belief functions, CDC offers interval-valued
  risks and set-valued decisions, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results
  on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDC effectively balances accuracy
  and determinacy by allowing for set-valued predictions in uncertain contexts, often
  outperforming or matching traditional precise classifiers.
