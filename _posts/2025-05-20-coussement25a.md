title: Conditioning and AGM-like belief change in the Desirability-Indifference framework
abstract: We show how the AGM framework for belief change (expansion, revision, contraction)
  can be extended to deal with conditioning in the so-called Desirability-Indifference
  framework, based on abstract notions of accepting and rejecting options, as well
  as on abstract notions of events. This level of abstraction allows us to deal simultaneously
  with classical and quantum probability theory.
