title: Optimal transport for $ε$-contaminated credal sets
abstract: We present generalized versions of Monge’s and Kantorovich’s optimal transport
  problems with the probabilities being transported replaced by lower probabilities.
  We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated
  sets, then our version of Monge’s, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich’s
  problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient
  conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich’s optimal plan, and for
  the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations
  the lower probability versions of Monge’s and Kantorovich’s optimal transport problems
  need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial
  Intelligence are also discussed.
