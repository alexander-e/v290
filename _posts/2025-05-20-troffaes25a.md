title: A robust Bayesian model to quantify and adjust for study quality and conflict
  of interest in meta-analyses
abstract: Meta-analyses are vital for synthesizing evidence in medical research, but
  conflicts of interest can introduce research bias, undermining the reliability of
  the synthesized findings. This paper proposes a new robust Bayesian meta-analysis
  model. The model inflates uncertainty of low-quality studies and incorporates a
  bias term for studies subject to conflicts of interest. Using a random-effects model
  and sensitivity analysis with bounded probabilities, the model enables robust adjustments
  for conflicts of interest in meta-analytic contexts. A case study on antidepressant
  trials illustrates the potential application of the model.
