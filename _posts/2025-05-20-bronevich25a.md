title: D-separation for the strong extension and the main natural extension of a credal
  network
abstract: 'In the paper, we consider two possible extensions of a credal network:
  the strong extension and the main natural extension. We prove that for both extensions
  the condition of the $d$-separation is preserved. The proof is based on some properties
  of conditional independence in such credal networks.'
