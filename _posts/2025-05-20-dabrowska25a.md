title: The marginal problem for sets of desirable gamble sets
abstract: We study the marginal problem for sets of desirable gamble sets (SoDGSes),
  which is equivalent to studying this problem for choice functions. More specifically,
  given a number of marginal SoDGSes on overlapping domains, we establish conditions
  under which they are compatible in the sense that they can be derived from a common
  joint SoDGS. We do so for SoDGSes that admit a concrete finite representation. Our
  main result is that such SoDGSes are compatible if they are pairwise compatible
  and if a running intersection property is satisfied.
