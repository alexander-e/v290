title: A convenient characterisation of convergent upper transition operators
abstract: 'Motivated by its connection to the limit behaviour of imprecise Markov
  chains, we introduce and study the so-called convergence of upper transition operators:
  the condition that for any function, the orbit resulting from iterated application
  of this operator converges. In contrast, the existing notion of ‘ergodicity’ requires
  convergence of the orbit to a constant. We derive a very general (and practically
  verifiable) sufficient condition for convergence in terms of accessibility and lower
  reachability, and prove that this sufficient condition is also necessary whenever
  (i) all transient states are absorbed or (ii) the upper transition operator is finitely
  generated.'
