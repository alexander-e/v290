title: Time-slice Bayesianism as a potential solution to the problem of dilation and
  reflection for imprecise probabilities
abstract: One of the main objections against an imprecise probabilistic framework
  is the apparent absurdity of dilation when seemingly irrelevant evidence makes your
  belief in a proposition much less certain than it intuitively ought to be. In this
  work, after critically analysing an argument by White and refined by Topey, as well
  as responses by imprecise probabilists, I argue that one way to greatly alleviate
  the tension this type of case poses is to adopt a form of ’time-slice’ Bayesianism.
  In the form I envision it, it means that our degrees of belief in A at time $t_i$
  are no longer <em>ontologically</em> defined as the result of updating our degrees
  of belief at time $t_{i-1}$ with the evidence $E_{i-1,i}$ we obtained in between,
  but as a function of our total evidence available at time $t_i$ and a fundamental
  prior set of credences. I explain why this move, which forces us to regard all probabilities
  as conditional probabilities <em>outside time</em>, greatly diminishes the <em>intuitive</em>
  appeal of dilation-based counterexamples to the soundness of imprecise Bayesianism.
