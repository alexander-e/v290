title: Rank-based decision theory and conditional deontic logic
abstract: Ranking theory is a well-established account of rational belief (= taking
  to be true) and its dynamics. Each formal representation of epistemic states should
  be extendable to a decision theory; ultimately, beliefs manifest themselves in rational
  action. However, the decision-theoretic extension of ranking theory is wanting.
  Giang and Shenoy’s “A Qualitative Linear Utility Theory for Spohn’s Theory of Epistemic
  Beliefs” (2000) is the only proposal so far. This paper will modify this proposal.
  The modification allows building a bridge to the field of (conditional) deontic
  logic, indeed advancing this field and thus instructing legal theory. This is to
  show that the modification is a fruitful one deserving further investigation and
  application.
