title: Elicitation for sets of probabilities and distributions
abstract: We investigate techniques for applying strictly proper scoring rules to
  elicit arbitrary sets of probabilities for an event and for eliciting sets of countably
  additive (finite dimensional) joint distributions. We contrast <em>E</em>-admissibility,
  Maximality, and $\Gamma$-Maximin as three IP decision rules for these elicitations.
  The techniques we investigate apply with sets of probabilities that need not be
  convex or even connected, and with distributions that may lack moments. We address
  some challenges to applying these techniques for eliciting merely finitely additive
  probability distributions.
