title: Conformal prediction regions are imprecise highest density regions
abstract: Recently, Cella and Martin proved how, under an assumption called <em>consonance</em>,
  a credal set (i.e. a closed and convex set of probabilities) can be derived from
  the conformal transducer associated with transductive conformal prediction. We show
  that the Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) associated with such a credal set
  corresponds to the classical Conformal Prediction Region. In proving this result,
  we establish a new relationship between Conformal Prediction and Imprecise Probability
  (IP) theories, via the IP concept of a cloud. A byproduct of our presentation is
  the discovery that consonant plausibility functions are monoid homomorphisms, a
  new algebraic property of an IP tool.
