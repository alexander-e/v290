title: On the value of varied evidence for imprecise probabilities
abstract: It has long been considered a truism that we can learn more from a variety
  of sources than from highly correlated sources. This truism is captured by the Variety
  of Evidence Thesis. To the surprise of many, this thesis turned out to fail in a
  number of Bayesian settings. In other words, replication can trump variation. Translating
  the thesis into IP we obtain two distinct, a priori plausible formulations in terms
  of ‘increased confirmation’ and ‘uncertainty reduction’, respectively. We investigate
  both formulations, which both fail for different parameters and different reasons,
  that cannot be predicted prior to formal analysis. The emergence of two distinct
  formulations distinguishing confirmation increase from uncertainty reduction, which
  are conflated in the Bayesian picture, highlights fundamental differences between
  IP and Bayesian reasoning.
