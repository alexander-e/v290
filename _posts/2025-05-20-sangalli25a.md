title: 'Towards conservative inference in credal networks using belief functions:
  the case of credal chains'
abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
  theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for propagating
  uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains. The proposed approach
  efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief and plausibility functions,
  combining computational speed with robust uncertainty representation. Key contributions
  include formalizing belief-based inference methods and comparing belief-based inference
  against classical sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages
  and limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing insights
  into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in general.
