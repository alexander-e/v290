title: Distribution-free possibilistic inference on conditional quantities
abstract: Uncertainty quantification for conditional quantities—i.e., unknown quantities
  related to the conditional distribution of a response variable given covariates—is
  a fundamental problem. Existing methods often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions
  or smoothness conditions and typically only provide set estimates for the unknown
  quantities. This paper introduces Inferential Models (IMs) that offer possibilistic
  uncertainty quantification for conditional quantities, going beyond the simple provision
  of set estimates. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed IMs are fully distribution-free
  and can handle both random and fixed conditional quantities. Moreover, they satisfy
  a marginal validity criterion, ensuring proper calibration of all IMs’ outputs when
  averaged over the covariates distribution. Illustrations of this framework are provided
  for both random and fixed conditional quantities—specifically, a future response
  and the conditional median, respectively.
