title: Decision-theoretic properties of possibilistic inferential models
abstract: Inferential models (IMs) are data-dependent, imprecise-probabilistic structures
  designed to quantify uncertainty about unknowns. As the name suggests, the focus
  has been on uncertainty quantification for inference and on its reliability properties
  in that context. The present paper develops an IM framework for decision making,
  and investigates the decision-theoretic implications of the IM’s reliability guarantees.
  I show that the IM’s assessment of an action’s quality, defined by a Choquet integral,
  will not be too optimistic compared to that of an oracle. This ensures that the
  IM tends not to favor actions that the oracle doesn’t also favor, hence a IM is
  reliable for decision making too. In a certain special class of structured statistical
  models, further connections can be made between the IM’s recommended actions and
  those recommended by Bayesian/fiducial frameworks, from which certain optimality
  conclusions can be drawn.
