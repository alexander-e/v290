title: Function-coherent gambles with non-additive sequential dynamics
abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a rigorous foundation for imprecise
  probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility via its coherence axioms.
  In our related work, we introduced function-coherent gambles to accommodate non-linear
  utility. However, when repeated gambles are played over time—especially in intertemporal
  choice where rewards compound multiplicatively—the standard additive combination
  axiom fails to capture the appropriate long-run evaluation. In this paper we extend
  the framework by relaxing the additive combination axiom and introducing a nonlinear
  combination operator that effectively aggregates repeated gambles in the log-domain.
  This operator preserves the time-average (geometric) growth rate and addresses the
  ergodicity problem. We prove the key algebraic properties of the operator, discuss
  its impact on coherence, risk assessment, and representation, and provide a series
  of illustrative examples. Our approach bridges the gap between expectation values
  and time averages and unifies normative theory with empirically observed non-stationary
  reward dynamics.
