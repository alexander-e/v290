title: Conditioning through indifference in quantum mechanics
abstract: We can learn (more) about the state that a quantum system is in through
  measurements. We look at how to describe the uncertainty about a quantum systemâ€™s
  state conditional on executing such measurements. We show that by exploiting the
  interplay between desirability, coherence and indifference, a general rule for conditioning
  can be derived. We then apply this rule to conditioning on measurement outcomes,
  and show how it generalises to conditioning on a set of measurement outcomes.
