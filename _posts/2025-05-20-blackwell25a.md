title: Coherent rejection functions for arbitrary things
abstract: 'This paper investigates how to characterize (axiomatize) coherent rejection
  functions for arbitrary objects. In this very general setting, we assume that there
  is some sensible notion of preference over these objects, the existence of an “objective”
  background order treated as a constraint on preferences, and that the preferences
  constitute a strict partial order; we assume nothing else about the structure of
  the objects. The first insight is that we can represent binary comparisons of objects
  by ordered pairs – which are just another kind of thing; it is simple to represent
  coherent preference orders directly in terms of these higher-order objects. Once
  we have coherence axioms for sets of desirable things of this kind, we can immediately
  see what the corresponding coherence axioms are for sets of desirable sets (SDS)
  of these things. But these are not in one-to-one correspondence with rejection functions
  for the original things; they express more. The second insight is that rejection
  functions do correspond (almost) exactly to objects we will call “set preferences”.
  So I give coherence axioms for set preferences, which equivalently fully characterize
  coherence for rejection functions. I present two main results: (1) coherence axioms
  for set preferences, and (2) the connection between coherent rejection functions
  for the original things and coherence for SDS of the ordered-pair things.'
