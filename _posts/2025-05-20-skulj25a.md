title: Random walks on graphs with interval weights as a model of reversible imprecise
  Markov chains
abstract: We consider random walks on weighted graphs where the edge weights are interval-valued,
  reflecting uncertainty in the relationships between vertices. We study this model
  in the framework of reversible imprecise Markov chains by viewing them as sets of
  precise inhomogeneous Markov chains. We define and analyze the notion of reversibility
  for such sets by extending classical reversibility concepts to the imprecise setting.
  These concepts are then applied to interval-weighted random walks, where the individual
  weight functions may not be symmetric but their sets exhibit symmetry. Our approach
  provides a basis for analyzing random walks in environments with uncertain or incomplete
  information.
