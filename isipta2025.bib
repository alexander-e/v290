    abstract = {The off-switch problem is a critical challenge in AI control: if an AI system resists being switched off, it poses a significant risk. In this paper, we model the off-switch problem as a signalling game, where a human decision-maker communicates its preferences about some underlying decision problem to an AI agent, which then selects actions to maximise the human's utility. We assume that the human is a bounded rational agent and explore various bounded rationality mechanisms. Using real machine learning models, we reprove prior results and demonstrate that a necessary condition for an AI system to refrain from disabling its off-switch is its uncertainty about the human's utility. We also analyse how message costs influence optimal strategies and extend the analysis to scenarios involving incomparability.},

    author = {Blackwell, Kevin},
    abstract = {This paper investigates how to characterize (axiomatize) coherent rejection functions for arbitrary objects. In this very general setting, we assume that there is some sensible notion of preference over these objects, the existence of an ``objective'' background order treated as a constraint on preferences, and that the preferences constitute a strict partial order; we assume nothing else about the structure of the objects. The first insight is that we can represent binary comparisons of objects by ordered pairs -- which are just another kind of thing; it is simple to represent coherent preference orders directly in terms of these higher-order objects. Once we have coherence axioms for sets of desirable things of this kind, we can immediately see what the corresponding coherence axioms are for sets of desirable sets (SDS) of these things. But these are not in one-to-one correspondence with rejection functions for the original things; they express more. The second insight is that rejection functions do correspond (almost) exactly to objects we will call ``set preferences''. So I give coherence axioms for set preferences, which equivalently fully characterize coherence for rejection functions. I present two main results: (1) coherence axioms for set preferences, and (2) the connection between coherent rejection functions for the original things and coherence for SDS of the ordered-pair things.},

This paper introduces Inferential Models (IMs) that offer possibilistic uncertainty quantification for conditional quantities, going beyond the simple provision of set estimates. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed IMs are fully distribution-free and can handle both random and fixed conditional quantities. Moreover, they satisfy a marginal validity criterion, ensuring proper calibration of all IMs' outputs when averaged over the covariates distribution. Illustrations of this framework are provided for both random and fixed conditional quantities---specifically, a future response and the conditional median, respectively.},

In the hope to mitigate such issues, we introduce the Credal Discrete Classifier (CDC), an imprecise-probabilistic extension of the traditional Bayesian approach. By representing uncertainties in the estimated probabilities through belief functions, CDC offers interval-valued risks and set-valued decisions, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDC effectively balances accuracy and determinacy by allowing for set-valued predictions in uncertain contexts, often outperforming or matching traditional precise classifiers.},

In this work, after critically analysing an argument by White and refined by Topey, as well as responses by imprecise probabilists, I argue that one way to greatly alleviate the tension this type of case poses is to adopt a form of 'time-slice' Bayesianism. In the form I envision it, it means that our degrees of belief in A at time $t_i$ are no longer <em>ontologically</em> defined as the result of updating our degrees of belief at time $t_{i-1}$ with the evidence $E_{i-1,i}$ we obtained in between, but as a function of our total evidence available at time $t_i$ and a fundamental prior set of credences. I explain why this move, which forces us to regard all probabilities as conditional probabilities <em>outside time</em>, greatly diminishes the <em>intuitive</em> appeal of dilation-based counterexamples to the soundness of imprecise Bayesianism.},

In this pioneering work, based on a numerically generated synthetic dataset of conversion profiles, we address the uncertainty arising from variations in powder particle size between any two small powder samples, which impacts experimental conversion profiles. This variation is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution and is propagated into the uncertainty of the activation energy, which subsequently affects the uncertainty of the delay time at which the chemical conversion reaches a desired value under other conditions. Both precise and imprecise Bayesian approaches were compared. The results indicate that precise Bayesian methods struggle to differentiate effectively between varying levels of knowledge. In contrast, the imprecise Bayesian method based on a set of truncated normal distributions proved efficient and significantly more useful than the one based on uniform priors for this purpose. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to apply this methodology to more realistic settings.},

Translating the thesis into IP we obtain two distinct, a priori plausible formulations in terms of `increased confirmation' and `uncertainty reduction', respectively. We investigate both formulations, which both fail for different parameters and different reasons, that cannot be predicted prior to formal analysis. The emergence of two distinct formulations distinguishing confirmation increase from uncertainty reduction, which are conflated in the Bayesian picture, highlights fundamental differences between IP and Bayesian reasoning.},

I show that the IM's assessment of an action's quality, defined by a Choquet integral, will not be too optimistic compared to that of an oracle. This ensures that the IM tends not to favor actions that the oracle doesn't also favor, hence a IM is reliable for decision making too. In a certain special class of structured statistical models, further connections can be made between the IM's recommended actions and those recommended by Bayesian/fiducial frameworks, from which certain optimality conclusions can be drawn.},
